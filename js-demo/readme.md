principles

- demonstrates non-trivial network logic (ease of integration)
- demonstrates speed+reliabilty benefits
- showcases a/b comparisons of network efficiency
- integrates demonstration of network failure handling

reusable components, modular app pieces that can be plug+play

- rtc-editor (line, word, cursor locks) (**i like this)
- rt-voting
- offline-forms (signup, user data entry, ...)
- offline-inapp-messaging
- scrolling/viewport analytics (local storage with delayed bulk push)
- uber-like rt-location mapping (where are the tunnels? network switching)
	- group mapping?
- "flame wars" discussions
	- rework the "keep reloading until a reply shows up"
	- is this just a simplified push based networking lib for websockets?

viral/fun demonstrations, i.e., firebase's meteor multiplayer game
(fast, turn based game? with a complex move)

- scrabble? (**this is lame)
